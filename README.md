My learnings
- I finally got to try and reference this resource https://pencilandpaper.io/articles/ux-pattern-analysis-enterprise-data-tables/ for styling some tables. 
- I got to learn how overlay and pop-ups work
- I also got a bit of insight as to how data-attribute works, I used it to make it so that the table data would have a data reference as to what index the current book information 

The hardest part for me was to think of a design that doesnt look bad to me, and that was because my knowledge of how to actually style stuffs to end up in a certain way are way too limited. I had to find a youtube video on pop-ups because a form that readily appears on-site doesnt seem as appealing to me. As a bonus, i get to learn how overlays work and I was able to apply a function that would exit overlays and forms when clicking outside of the form.
